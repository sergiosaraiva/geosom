### Utilizing Self-Organizing Maps for Enhanced Geospatial Data Analysis in Geographic Information Systems

#### Abstract
This document presents a novel approach to geospatial data analysis using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), integrated within a Python-based class, GeoSom, designed to process and visualize geographic data from GeoPackage files. By combining attribute similarity with geographic proximity in its clustering methodology, our approach facilitates more nuanced insights into spatial data, enhancing applications in urban planning, environmental monitoring, and socio-demographic analysis. This paper details the implementation of the GeoSom class, explores its utility in geospatial analysis, and demonstrates how it leverages popular libraries for processing, machine learning, and visualization.

#### 1. Introduction
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), introduced by Teuvo Kohonen in the 1980s, are a type of artificial neural network that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional, discretized representation of input data. This technique preserves the topological properties of the original high-dimensional data and is particularly useful for visualizing and interpreting complex datasets. The application of SOMs to geospatial data enables the clustering of spatial entities not only based on their attributes but also their geographic locations, thereby supporting the generation of spatially contiguous clusters that are critical in many geographic information systems (GIS) applications.

#### 2. Methodology
The methodology section covers the implementation details of the GeoSom class which provides a comprehensive framework for the application of SOMs to geospatial data stored in GeoPackage (GPKG) files.

**2.1 Data Loading and Preprocessing**
GeoSom utilizes GeoPandas for reading and projecting geographic data to a suitable coordinate reference system (CRS). The geometries' centroids are computed to integrate geographic coordinates into the SOM analysis alongside user-defined attributes. Data normalization is performed using the MinMaxScaler from Scikit-Learn, enhancing the uniformity and accuracy of SOM training.

**2.2 SOM Implementation**
The SOM is implemented using the MiniSom library. The training process involves adjusting weights iteratively to match the input vectors, which, in this case, include both attribute values and geographic coordinates. The output is a set of clusters that represent the dataâ€™s structure in a two-dimensional grid format.

**2.3 Output Generation**
The clustered data is stored back into a GPKG file, alongside additional outputs including raster files for GIS applications and heatmaps for visual analysis. These outputs are generated using Rasterio, facilitating the conversion of clustered data into raster format and applying Gaussian filters to produce heatmaps.

#### 3. Results and Discussion
The application of the GeoSom class was tested on a dataset containing socio-demographic and environmental data for a metropolitan area. The results demonstrated that the GeoSom class effectively identified spatial patterns that were not apparent through traditional clustering methods. Clusters formed by the GeoSom closely corresponded to known geographic and demographic boundaries, validating the efficacy of integrating geographic coordinates into SOM analysis.

#### 4. Conclusion
The GeoSom class represents a significant advancement in the field of geospatial data analysis. By facilitating the integration of SOMs with geographic data processing, GeoSom allows for more sophisticated analysis and visualization of spatial data. This approach is particularly beneficial for applications requiring the interpretation of complex spatial patterns and can serve as a foundation for further research and development in geographic data analysis.
